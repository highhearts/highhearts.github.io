    <p>Hey everyone, we're happy to announce our new website.  One important enhancement will be to get all the songs in our repertoire up 
    here in a type of "<a href="http://songs.highhearts.com">Fakebook</a>".  This is as much for us as you, 
    as it's helpful to all of us to have a central place to go to learn (or relearn) songs.  It also lets any of our fans and friends easily learn and play these songs too.
    We'll also post some live tracks to this section, making it something of a High Hearts Archive.</p>
    <p> Finally, as always, we're focusing on expanding our mailing list.  This is our main way of
    letting people know about our shows, so make sure you sign up if you have not already.  We will be coming out with new recordings very soon, but it will be mainly 
    available for free download in exchange for joining our mailing list.  Those who are already on the list just need to let us know and we'll grant access to the music.</p>
